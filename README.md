# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments
## Hello CircuitPython (and Metro and Mu)
This assignment was an introduction to the new programming language and metro Express. The Metro express looks similar to the arduino, but in function, it's very differnent. Metro express runs CircuitPython. The assignment was to code our new metro to make it have an LED fade in and out.
