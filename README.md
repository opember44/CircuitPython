# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments
## Hello CircuitPython (and Metro and Mu)
### Objective
This assignment was an introduction to the new programming language and metro Express. The Metro express looks similar to the arduino, but in function, it's very differnent. Metro express runs CircuitPython. The assignment was to code our new metro to make it have an LED fade in and out.

### Lesson
This was our first assignment so I am starting to learn the basics of CircuitPython, more specifically, I learned what PMW (pulse width modulation) I also learned what the duty_cycle is.
## CircuitPython Servo
### Objective
The goal of this asignment was to make a servo move using capacitive touch using CircuitPython.

### Lessons
I learned that capacitive touch is when the metro can detect and make the servo move when you touch wires. I also learned how to move a servo on CircuitPython.
